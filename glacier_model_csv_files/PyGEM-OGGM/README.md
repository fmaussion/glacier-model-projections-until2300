# README PyGEM-OGGM

Projections have been run by David Rounce and Brandon Tober in October 2023. Lilian Schuster created regional and global aggregates from the per-glacier estimates. 
Only the common running glaciers of all scenarios and gcms for each region were selected (similar approach as in the [aggregated OGGM standard projections](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-standard-projections-csv-files).
The notebook that was used to aggregate the per-glacier files is accessible here: [nbviewer.org/urls/cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~lschuster/pygem_2023_data_until_2300/extract_rounce2023_csv_files.ipynb](nbviewer.org/urls/cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~lschuster/pygem_2023_data_until_2300/extract_rounce2023_csv_files.ipynb)
